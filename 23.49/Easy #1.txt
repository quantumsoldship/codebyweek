Welcome to your first (hopefully) Code by Week puzzle!

We’ll go ahead and get started!

—— CODE BY WEEK 23.49.E1 —
	Santa and his elves were messing around with their water pipeline last Tuesday.
However, they have accidentally broken all the water mains!
They are looking for a plumber, but since Mario and Luigi are both busy until next April, they would like to ask you to fix their water main.

Their water main used to look like this:

=======[SECTION]======[SECTION]====[SECTION]====

However, ever since they messed it up, it looks like this:
===[X9X18X8M23X37A21X30I14X42N26X35X5]=======[3X18X7P2X26X64O8X29X11W5X47X32E9X15X20R4X23]=====[X4H9X12E3X8A7X5I6X1N0X2T4XG11X15]===

You need to decode the sections and figure out what they actually are.
In order to do this, you’ll need to remove the ‘X’s and the numbers from the sections to recieve the final string of text.

Good luck!
