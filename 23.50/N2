Wow! Nice work!
You fix the conveyor belt, but after Santa turns it on, the screen glows with a message.

[ERROR] {FUSE-ERROR-BLOW6006WOLB]
 
You look it up in the Book of Many Errors: Santa Edition, and it turns out that it means that 40% of every single fuse in the building has blown.
You were wondering why it was suddenly so dark.
A mechanic elf walks up and tells you that because all the fuses blew, every
fuse contains a list. The list has two sections. 
1st section: [FUSE N]
2nd section: [XJFDJ, HGHDJ, JJEKE, BLWOE, BLOWN, JWFJF, QEWEW, HIPPO] 
The second section sometimes has a BLOWN somehwere in it. 

Hereâ€™s an example of the fuses:
[FUSE 1][XJFDJ, HGHDJ, JJEKE, BLWOE, BLOWN, JWFJF, QEWEW, HIPPO]
[FUSE 2][BLWOE, BLOWN, HGHDJ, HIPPO, JJEKE, JWFJF, QEWEW, XJFDJ]


If a fuse is blown, it will contain BLOWN somewhere in the list.
If it isn't, it won't
Find the sum of all the blown fuses.
Expected Result:
An integer.
