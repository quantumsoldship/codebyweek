Welcome to part 3!
In the last puzzle, you discovered that Santa’s pipe defrost machine said that
it required power. How do you give it power? You flip the power switch, of course.
It’s disapointingly not that easy, however.

a) The switch requires a password.
b) You don’t know the password.
c) We have a problem

Fortunately, you don’t have to trod all the way back to Santa’s house, becuase an elf left an encrypted file in the building’s mainframe.

The file looks like this:
[The password is: {
70617373776F726431323373616E74616973636F6F6C3536373877686F6477656170707265636961746553616E746121
}

It looks like this password is in hexadecimal!
You’ll need to decode it somehow.

Expected result:
The decoded string

Good luck!
