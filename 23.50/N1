Wow!
Great job on those problems!
Obtain one golden wrench. Feel happy. Etc.

After fixing the water main, you are about to return home when Santa needs you for one more thing.
It sounds like their toy production line’s conveyor belt is broken. You walk over and find it shooting sparks while the toy-making elves cower in a corner.
Santa guides you to the control booth, and you discover 
that a crippling Windows 12.5.6.3.4.66.43.134.AB™ update has damaged the Toy Production Drive v1.6.93.

The toy drive seems to have blown all the fuses that are prime numbers or even, among others. Odd.

This example shows what some fuses may look like
[F1][B,NB,OFF,2]
[F2][B,NB,OFF,2]
[F3][B,NB,OFF,3]
[F4][B,NB,OFF,1]
[F5][B,NB,OFF,1]

As you may be able to discern, the first set of brackets symbolizes the fuse.
The second set of brackets reads [B,NB,N], B means Blown, NB means Not Blown, and the last number, N, symbolizes whether it’s blown or not.
If it’s a 1, it’s blown. If it’s 2, it’s not blown. If it’s 3, it’s off and doesn’t need to be fixed.
Santa knows how to fix all the non-prime, odd fuses, but he would like you to fix the prime ones.

You need to figure out the sum of all the blown fuses which are either prime numbers or even.
Expected result:
An integer.
