Welcome to Code by Week!

	In these puzzles, you’ll be given a problem, and you’ll try to solve it using the language of your choice. The puzzles are seperated into 6 sections, Easy (#1, #2, and #3), Normal (#1 and #2, and Difficult (Just one). You’ll be awarded points based on the difficulty of the problem.

	Your points total 100. The list of points are:

	Easy #1 = 5
	Easy #2 = 10
	Easy #3 = 15
	Normal #1 = 10
	Normal #2 = 20
	Hard #1 = 30

	Bonus:
	If you complete them all, you get an extra 10 Points.

Week 23.49 comes out on Sunday!
